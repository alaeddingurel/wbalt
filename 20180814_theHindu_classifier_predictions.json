Nagappan and M. Sathyanarayanan, passed the interim order on petitions by Perarivalan, Santhan and Murugan. As the matter involved the consideration of a question of law, the petitions were being admitted and there would be an interim injunction, the Bench said.\nAdditional Solicitor-General M. Ravindran and Advocate-General A. Navaneethakrishnan took notice for the Central and State governments. The Bench said the counter should be filed in eight weeks.\nAs soon as the order was dictated in the court hall, there were joyous shouts inside and outside.\nSlogans were raised on the court premises. Crackers were burst in front of the court.\nThe petitioners' main contention was that the delay in disposal of the mercy petitions by 11 years and four months made the execution of the death sentence \u201cunduly harsh and excessive,\u201d amounting to violation of their right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. The sentence of death after 20 years of incarceration was \u201cunjust and inhuman.\u201d\nThe High Court's \u2014 and, eventually, Supreme Court's \u2014 ruling on the present matter will have implications for other high profile convicts on death row, including Afzal Guru and Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, who have cited the lengthy delay in the disposal of their own mercy petitions as grounds for clemency.\nSanthan and Murugan submitted that the jurisprudence in this issue was clearly developed by the Supreme Court. The consistent position was that if the delay was shown to be excessive and unjustified in the facts of the case, execution of the death sentence would amount to harsh and inhuman punishment violative of Article 21. The court should commute the death sentence.\nSenior advocates Ram Jethmalani, R. Vaigai and Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the prisoners, argued that the long delay rendered the death penalty illegal and unconstitutional.\nMDMK general secretary Vaiko, Perarivalan's mother Arputhammal and film director and leader of the Naam Tamizhar Iyakkam Seeman were among those present in the court hall.\nThere was jubilation on the court premises after the order. Members of various organisations raised slogans demanding the abolition of the death penalty.\nFighting back tears, Arputhammal said the three were innocent. They should be allowed to live. She thanked all those who struggled for the cause of her son and those who had brought a resolution in the Legislative Assembly appealing for commutation of their sentence.\nurl : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/staying-execution-in-rajiv-case-high-court-to-hear-cruelty-plea\/article2413239.ece\n","label":null,"Classifier_disaggrements":null,"RF_prediction":0,"SVM_prediction":0,"classifier_prediction":1.0},"2484":{"url":"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-telangana\/hyderabad-today\/article7091512.ece","text":"TELANGANA\nHyderabad today\nApril 11, 2015 00:00 IST\nRELIGION\nSree Ranganadha Swamy temple: Annual Brahmotsavams, 9 a.m. to 6.30 p.m.\nGENERAL\nNizam\u2019s Institute of Medical Sciences: Awareness programme on Parkinson\u2019s disease, NIMS Learning Centre, Punjagutta, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.\nVidhi Manch: 27{+t}{+h}Foundation Day celebrations, Hotel Sri Venkateswara, Lakdi-ka-pool, 6.30 p.m.\nTelangana Resource Centre: Meet with Rakesh Reddy Dubbudu on \u2018Role of RTI in Building a Corruption Free Telangana\u2019, Oxford Grammar School, Himayatnagar, Street No.12, 5.30 p.m.\nICFAI Group: Valedictory of seminar on \u2018Corporate Spectrum-Legal Facies\u2019 ICFAI University campus, Shankerpally road, 4 p.m.\nCULTURE\nDeccan History Society and Historical Society of Hyderabad: Release of book \u2018Studies in Medieval Deccan History\u2019, Salarjung Museum, 11 a.m.\nAlankritha Art Gallery: The iPhoneogaphy Show by Shiva Chiluveru, 41A, Sarojini Naidu Nagar, Kavuri Hills, 7 p.m.\nAilamma Art Gallery: \u2018Serene Revelations\u2019, exhibition of paintings by H.R.

Ilangovan\nSALEM: For her and other school students who are eligible for free travel, commuting in the town's Government buses has been a harrowing experience.\nA majority of the bus crew of the Salem Division of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation and even a few private operators, these students claim, need to be sensitised about the traffic rules and amiable public disposition to the passengers and particularly with the students and children.\nThe crew either stop in the middle of the road or far away from the bus stop. Before the students could get in or disembark, the drivers tend to take the buses thus causing many a road accident in which school children became the victims.\nA bunch of schoolgirls, led by K. Priyadarshini studying in the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Fort here came to the Collectorate on Monday to explain these hardships to the Collector. They said that bus services between Yercaud Foot hills and City were far and few between. Even the regular services were erratic, they charged. Many students were forced to disembark right in the middle of the road near the Collectorate traffic signal thus exposing them to dangers of accidents.\nurl : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-tamilnadu\/for-a-safe-travel\/article18429933.ece\n","label":null,"Classifier_disaggrements":null,"RF_prediction":0,"SVM_prediction":0,"classifier_prediction":1.0},"2688":{"url":"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-features\/tp-metroplus\/Twin-treat\/article15523634.ece","text":"METRO PLUS\nTwin treat\nJanuary 19, 2011 00:00 IST\nLAUNCH The audios of \u201cThoonganagaram\u201d and \u201cSankarankoil\u201d\nT he audio CD of Cloud Nine Movies' first film \u201cThoonganagaram\u201d, produced by Thayanidhi Azhagiri and Vivek Rathnavel, was launched recently by director Gautham Vasudev Menon and received by director Lingusamy. Directors K.V.Anand, K.S.Ravikumar, Ameer, Sasi Kumar and Samudirakani spoke on the occasion. An associate of director K.S.Ravikumar, Gaurav, who makes his directorial debut, said \u201cThoonganagaram\u201d was another name for Madurai.\n\u201cAs far as this film is concerned, everything is new. We selected 70 from as many as 3,000 people from Madurai to act in it. We shot Madurai's popular \u2018Chitirai Thiruviza' for nearly four days. For the first time, we shot from the gopuram of the Madurai Meenakshi temple.\nThe music has been scored by Sundar C.Babu and recorded at Sono Records, Prague, the very studio where ace director Steven Spielberg worked for many of his films.\nAlso it was here music director A. R. Rahman recorded the music for his first Hollywood film, \u201cThe Warriors of the Heaven and Earth\u201d. There are seven numbers in the album, each different from the other. \u2018Vaigai siricha' sung by Palghat Sriram tells us why Madurai is called \u201cThoonganagaram\u201d. The lyrics for the song have been penned by S. Gnanakaravel. \u2018Koorana Parvaigal', written by Thamarai, is a melody where Hariharan excels with Chinmayi. \u2018Kalyanam' in yesteryear actor Chandrababu's voice has been remixed in an interesting way with Karthik singing along for Narayana Kavi's lines. \u2018Ettu Kangalukkum' in the beautiful voice of Madhu Balakrishnan and written by S.Gnanakaravel scores among the best in the album. \u2018Nee Siricha Kondattam', penned by S. Annamalai and sung by Shankar Mahadevan, is notable. The last two songs in the album are \u2018Rhythm' and the theme song of \u201cThoonganagaram\u201d.\nSankarankoil\nSivadharshini Cine Aarts \u201cSankarankoil\u201d is the second outing of stunt master \u2018Kanal' Kannan as actor in the lead role. He has earlier played the hero in \u201cSatru Mun Kidaitha Thagaval\u201d. In this film, new face Roopika is being paired with him.\nThe others in the cast include Rohini, Ponvannan, \u2018Ganja' Karuppu, Singampuli, JS and Sams. Prabhu plays a meaty role as Muthuvel while Nasser and K. S. Ravikumar appear in important roles. T. Ram Tulasi handles the camera, while newcomer Rajni composes the music. P. N. Palanivelraja has written the story, screenplay and dialogue in addition to directing the film. Hemavathi Kannan produces the movie.\nThere are six songs in the film of which \u2018Manushana Manushan', written by Viveka and sung by the music director himself, scores as the best. \u2018Thenpandi Makkalin' is a pleasant number sung by Sriram and written by Mohanrajan.\nThe song \u2018Kottapakkum', written by Snegan, showcases the varied range of singer Malathi \u2014 she sings it with Sunandhan. Snegan has also written the sensual duet \u2018Puli Varuthu' to which Mukesh and Priyadarshini have lent their voice. \u2018Mudhan Mudhalaka', again written by Snegan and sung by Balaji and Surmukhi, is delightful. \u2018Enga Kulasamy', sung by Rajini, is a small piece written by Mohanrajan.\nS.

The injustice had been continued, despite drawing the attention of the Government in this regard, by way of boycotting the evaluation in April, he said.\nThe disparity had continued ever since the recommendations of the fourth and fifth pay commissions were implemented. With the implementation of the sixth pay commission's recommendations, the disparity had increase enormously.\nThe Government, in response to a memorandum, had constituted a committee, headed by Kumar Naik, senior officer, to study the pay scales, to which the association had given a representation mentioning about the injustice meted out to its members.\nThe committee had submitted its report. But, so far, the Government had not taken any steps to make the recommendations public, he said.\nMr. Reddy said that the association members, drawn from all over the district, would go on a mass leave on Monday, take out a rally to the Deputy Commissioner's office and submit a memorandum. Later, they would stage a dharna in front of the Deputy Commissioner's office.

After the signing of the accord, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claimed that the political impasse in the hill areas was on its way to being ended and that the \u201cmatter [was] settled.\u201d\nBut the GJM said that part of the consensus was that the new set-up would be formed \u201cwithout diluting\u201d its main agenda for a Gorkhaland state, though the demand had been set aside for now.\nBarely an hour after Ms. Banerjee described the agreement as \u201chistorical\u201d and the culmination of a prolonged agitation by the GJM, party general secretary Roshan Giri told The Hindu:\u201cIt has been reiterated in the minutes of today's meeting that the main agenda of Gorkhaland must not be diluted or prejudiced.\u201d\n\u201cIt has been made clear that there can be an agreement for a bigger, more powerful body to replace the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council without diluting our main agenda for a separate State,\u201d he said.\nIt was agreed after more than three hours of talks \u2014 first between the GJM leaders and the State government represented by, among others, Chief Secretary Samar Ghosh and Home Secretary G.D. Gautama, and then a brief round of discussions with the Chief Minister \u2014 that a new elected body would be set up for the Darjeeling hills even as a nine-member high-level committee comprising representatives of the Centre, the State government and the GJM looked into the question of bringing the Gorkha-dominated areas in the Dooars and the Terai under its jurisdiction. It would submit its recommendations within six months.\nThe talks between the GJM and the officials resumed during the day after they ended inconclusively on Monday.\nThe new setup would have full administrative, financial and executive powers and would be given more autonomy than the DGHC, Mr. Ghosh said.\nOnce a tripartite agreement involving the Centre was formalised, a Bill would be introduced in the Assembly at the earliest, so that the process of election for the new body could be initiated.\nTill the body was set up, a five-member committee would constitute a board of administrators to oversee the development process in the hills. Another committee would be set up to look into the GJM's demand for investing the body with the authority for land management of tea-gardens and submit its recommendations within two weeks.\nPointing out that with the \u201cofficial-level agreement\u201d the \u201cburning issue of Bengal\u201d had finally been addressed, the Chief Minister said she had informed Union Home Minister P Chidambaram that \u201cthe matter has been settled.\u201d\nThe State would seek an early round of tripartite talks \u2014 if possible within a week \u2014 to be held in Darjeeling to put the final seal of approval on the settlement, Ms. Banerjee said. Asked what the magic formula was applied to arrive at an agreement, she said: \u201cIt is development.

Rural colleges would be given an additional 10 per cent over and above the 20 per cent.\n\u201cThis will ensure that students from rural areas do not have to travel long distances or stay in hostels to pursue higher education,\u201d Mr. Thiruvasagam said.\nAs regards the other condition of a full-time principal, he said more than 25 per cent of the colleges did not have a principal.\nThere were many who came and went in the garb of acting principals. This was no use to the college, he said.\nHence, if the above two conditions were fulfilled, additional seats would not be denied to colleges, he said.\nurl : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-tamilnadu\/Conditional-allotment-of-extra-seats-to-colleges-VC\/article16580211.ece\n","label":null,"Classifier_disaggrements":null,"RF_prediction":0,"SVM_prediction":0,"classifier_prediction":0.0},"9600":{"url":"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-andhrapradesh\/neckandneck-contest-in-bhongir\/article5939354.ece","text":"BHONGIR:\nNeck-and-neck contest in Bhongir\nApril 23, 2014 00:00 IST\nIt could be a touch-and-go affair and the going may not be that easy for the incumbent Congress MP Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy from this Lok Sabha seat where his main rivals are a surgeon-turned-politician, Dr. Boora Narsaiah Goud of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), and veteran BJP politician N. Indrasena Reddy in a multi-cornered contest.\nIn the 2009 elections, Mr. Rajgopal Reddy, hailing from a family of politicians, made his electoral debut and defeated his nearest CPI (M) rival with a margin of more than 1.4 lakh votes. The CPI (M) then was part of the grand alliance formed by TDP, TRS and the Left parties. TDP joined hands with the BJP this time.\nIn all, 13 candidates are in the fray, including CPI (M)\u2019s Cherupally Seetharamulu. Nominees of BSP, RLD, Jaisamaikyandhra party, AIMIM, Mahajan Socialist Party and three independents are testing their electoral fortunes.\nAlthough three of the seven Assembly seats are held by Congress MLAs, group politics within the party might become a major headache for Mr. Rajgopal Reddy. His rivals and political observers feel that dissensions within the Congress might undermine his chances. The lack of adequate cadre in all the Assembly segments could be a major disadvantage for the TRS while the BJP\u2019s presence is confined to a few urban pockets and the party would have to depend heavily on TDP in rural areas.\nMr. Rajagopal Reddy is believed to be not seeing eye-to eye with senior Congress leader R. Damodar Reddy, who has following in Tungathurthy segment. Similarly, another Congress leader Chinthala Venkateshwar Reddy, who was denied ticket from Bhongir Assembly constituency, might not work wholeheartedly. Senior Congress leader Palvai Goverdhan Reddy\u2019s daughter Palvai Sravanthi contesting from Munugode as a rebel after the seat was allotted to CPI and the reported differences between him and Telangana Congress Committee chief Ponnala Lakshmaiah (who is seeking re-election from Jangaon) as also with Alair Congress MLA Bikshamaiah Goud could pose problems for Mr. Reddy.\nA positive development for Mr. Reddy was that two senior TDP leaders from Nakrekal and Munugode joined the Congress recently.\nA school teacher cited \u201cresentment\u201d among people that not enough development has taken place in the constituency and growing pro-Telangana sentiment favouring TRS as the other factors that could spoil the chances of the sitting MP. The teacher said there was no government degree college in Bhongir and good medical facilities were also lacking. Besides, people were facing water problem.\nMr. Rajagopal Reddy and his elder brother and former minister G. Venkat Reddy, however, are totally unfazed. They exuded confidence that Congress would not only fare well but form the next government by winning 12 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 70 of the 119 Assembly seats in Telangana region.\nThe message that Congress president Sonia Gandhi alone was responsible for creation of Telangana State has gone down to the people. Describing TRS as an issue-based party, they said the issue was closed as Telangana has already been achieved.\nTRS nominee Dr. Narsiah Goud described the contest between him and Mr. Rajagopal Reddy as a fight between money and principles and disaster versus development politics. \u201cI am sure people of Bhongir Parliamentary constituency will not succumb to money politics and rather vote for a person who sacrificed his profession, comfort for the sake of Telangana.\u201d But for TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao\u2019s commitment, neither Congress nor BJP would have thought of Telangana, he added.\nBJP candidate, Mr. Indrasena Reddy, who is campaigning on the planks of development and good governance, said there was positive impact in some places because of the party\u2019s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi.\nReferring to the fluoride problem in the areas falling under the constituency, he said there was a need for appointing a statutory body to tackle the issue.\nurl : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-andhrapradesh\/neckandneck-contest-in-bhongir\/article5939354.ece\n","label":null,"Classifier_disaggrements":null,"RF_prediction":0,"SVM_prediction":0,"classifier_prediction":0.0},"3110":{"url":"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/Orissa-accepts-8-Maoist-demands\/article15453900.ece","text":"BHUBANESWAR:\nOrissa accepts 8 Maoist demands\nFebruary 22, 2011 00:00 IST\nThe remaining six of the 14 demands will be discussed today\nThe Naveen Patnaik government on Monday accepted eight of the 14 demands Maoists made for the release of Malkangiri Collector R.

They formed a human chain at Vanaki Obavva Circle hampering vehicular movement for over 30 minutes.\nTerming this as the government selling out to the managements of private medical and engineering colleges, and not safeguarding the interests of poor, meritorious students, the protesters alleged that their academic future was now at the mercy of these managements.\nThey said that poor, meritorious students would be losing 45 per cent of medical seats, 40 per cent of engineering seats and 35 per cent of dental seats under the government quota in professional colleges run by private managements.\nNow along with their quota of seats, private managements would fill up 85 per cent of the seats in professional colleges by conducting entrance examinations through the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka (COMEDK).\nThe agitators alleged that there had been several complaints about the entrance examination conducted by the COMEDK in the previous years. Students from Karnataka would not get their due share in admission to professional colleges as the track record showed that majority of the seats were filled by students from other States, a large number of whom write the entrance examination conducted by COMEDK. The students said the government would now conduct the Common Entrance Test (CET) through the Karnataka Examinations Authority to fill up 5,000 seats in government medical and engineering colleges, while 75,000 seats in private medical and engineering colleges would be filled through the entrance examination conducted by COMEDK, they added.\nThe agitators submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah through Deputy Commissioner V.P.

Govind, president of the district unit of AIDSO, said that the Act would withdraw merit seats in all private professional colleges, according to a release.\nThe bandh call was to pressurise the government to retain the merit quota in private professional colleges and also to ensure that fees would be affordable to common man.\nProcession\nDavangere Staff Correspondent reports:\nStudents, under the banner of All-India Democratic Students Organisation, took out a procession here on Friday. They raised slogans against the government for allowing private professional colleges to \u2018rob\u2019 parents. The students held demonstrations at the Gandhi Circle. Later, they submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner. The students said the Act would have a disastrous impact on the future of students coming from poorer sections of society. The State government has taken the decision at the behest of a few Congress leaders who owned private engineering and medical colleges, the students said.\nA student who secures first rank in the Common Entrance Test will have to invariably spend an exorbitant amount to get admission in a prestigious college.

Now, the DAH is looking forward to gather 10,000 tonnes of green fodder in the next ten days.\nNational Seeds Corporation\n\u201cWe could achieve the milestone and record production, thanks to Collector V.Rajaraman, who helped procure seeds from the Delhi-based National Seeds Corporation (NSC) on time, and five spells of rain since the onset of the southwest monsoon,\u201d said S.Balakrishnan, Joint Director, DAH, Sivaganga.\nFarmers with land holdings of 0.5 acre to 5 acres and a herd size of 3 to 7 milch cows were roped in to cultivate the fodder after being given seeds at 50 per cent subsidised rate and having to bear half the production cost, he said. As the growth was healthy in all the fields in Kalaiyarkoil, Sivaganga, Singampunari, S Pudur and Thirupuvanam areas \u201cwe are confident of achieving the target of 10,000 tonnes,\u201d he said.\nMr. Balakrishnan said 50 per cent of the total production would be procured for to the members of milk producers\u2019 cooperative societies at 50 per cent subsidised rate. The rate of the fodder would be decided by a committee, headed by the Collector, he said. The livestock holders have 6,800 milch cows, and the members of the societies 750 to 800. The milk production stood at 51,000 litres a day. The supply of green fodder is expected to raise the milk output by 1,000 litres a day, he estimates.\nDuring the ensuing winter season, the department has proposed to cultivate three varieties of green fodder \u2013 sorghum and cowpea on about 300 acres and Co4 on 200 acres \u2013 under the Accelerated fodder development and State Fodder development schemes, he said. While sorghum and cowpea were meant for single cutting, Co4, which would be ready for cutting after 90 days, was meant for four cuttings a year.\nThe farmers would be given seeds of sorghum and cowpea and seedlings of Co4 from the Government Chettinad farm shortly at subsidised rates, he said.\nThe department will also distribute one lakh seedlings of \"Agathi Keerai\" to farmers in Sivaganga, Theni, Madurai, Dindigul and Ramanathapuram districts free of cost. The government has allocated a sum of Rs. 16 lakh for this purpose, he said.\nMr. Balakrishnan said the fodder development project was launched to motivate farmers to cultivate green fodder, maintain their livestock in good health and increase milk production. The problem of fodder shortage could be addressed if the farmers were encouraged to cultivate green fodder throughout the year, he suggested.\nurl : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-tamilnadu\/farmers-grow-green-fodder-to-tackle-shortage\/article5008810.ece\n","label":null,"Classifier_disaggrements":null,"RF_prediction":0,"SVM_prediction":0,"classifier_prediction":0.0},"7800":{"url":"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-features\/tp-metroplus\/for-designerwear\/article3433976.ece","text":"METRO PLUS\nFor designerwear\nMay 19, 2012 00:00 IST\nAs Pujaarya presents \u2018Hand Print Sorbet', her Autumn Winter '12 Collection.

However, after about five hours the Cane Commissioner, Sudhir Bobade arrived on the scene at around 10 PM and invited the RKMS convenor for fresh round of talks.\nThe talks lasted for 90 minutes during which the agreement was thrashed out.\nIt was at around midnight on Thursday that Mr. Singh announced to the farmers that the agitation had been called off following the Government\u2019s agreement on some of the important demands.\nThe Government has agreed to a uniform price of Rs. 210 to Rs. 215 per quintal to be paid by the sugar mills across the board. This meant that even the sugar mills owned by the Uttar Pradesh State Sugar Corporation Limited and the UP Cooperative Sugarcane Federation will have to pay the purchase price agreed by the Government.\nThe fresh price was inclusive of the state advised price of Rs. 165 and Rs. 170 per quintal and the cane development incentive of Rs. 45 given by the mill owners.\nSince the Government agreed to the payment of uniform price, the RKMS did not press on the farmers getting a price of Rs. 280 per quintal.\nThe State Government also agreed to give fresh directives to the divisional commissioners for ensuring that the SAP and the incentive were mentioned in cane purchase slips and form C.\nAccording to sugarcane officials, cane crushing operations had commenced in 125 mills, including 89 private mills.\nurl : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-otherstates\/Dharna-by-sugarcane-farmers-called-off\/article16828749.ece\n","label":null,"Classifier_disaggrements":null,"RF_prediction":1,"SVM_prediction":1,"classifier_prediction":1.0},"9601":{"url":"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-otherstates\/Project-to-study-longevity-of-Zoroastrians\/article15304646.ece","text":"OTHER STATES\nProject to study longevity of Zoroastrians\nSeptember 17, 2008 00:00 IST\nJAIPUR: A genome project launched by a Bangalore-based pharmaceutical firm will develop bio-markers for predictive diagnostics and drug discovery by studying the minuscule Zoroastrian population in the country and determine the genetic basis of longevity of Zoroastrians and its related disorders.\nAvesthagen Limited, working in the field of predictive and preventive personalised health care, has selected the 69,000-strong Zoroastrian community for the unique project in view of its uniform genome and well-documented ancestry and medical history.\n\u201cGenerations of marital and sexual relations confined within the small community have led to emergence of positive traits as well as occurrence of certain inherited diseases among Zoroastrians.\nThe project will try to identify drug targets by understanding the genetic structure of this rare population,\u201d said Avesthagen vice-president Anil Chauhan here.\nMr. Chauhan, who was in Jaipur in connection with a dance theatre performance on Zoroastrians, said their small population with a wealth of genetic, disease and genealogical information was a \u201cscarce resource\u201d in human genetics.\nAvesthagen has collected blood samples of about 3,000 Zoroastrians, settled mainly in Maharashtra and Gujarat, as part of the study.\nAccording to Mr. Chauhan, the project would initially focus on two neurological and two cancer conditions and would finally unravel the genetic basis of longevity of Zoroastrians.\nThe dance theatre performance, \u201cAnd they came to India\u201d, presented by Mallika Sarabhai and her troupe at Ravindra Manch here this past Sunday, traced the early Persians and their myths and the birth of Zoroastrianism in Iran and the migration of Zoroastrians \u2013 popularly called Parsis \u2013 to India.\nurl : http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-otherstates\/Project-to-study-longevity-of-Zoroastrians\/article15304646.ece\n","label":null,"Classifier_disaggrements":null,"RF_prediction":0,"SVM_prediction":0,"classifier_prediction":0.0},"9197":{"url":"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-national\/tp-tamilnadu\/attempt-to-run-over-two-youth-on-motorbike-one-held\/article6806833.ece","text":"COIMBATORE:\nAttempt to run over two youth on motorbike; one held\nJanuary 21, 2015 00:00 IST\nA 23-year-old man was arrested for conspiring to kill two youth on a motorbike by ramming a car against a two-wheeler, following a clash between two groups at a hotel on Avanashi Road near Hope College, on Sunday night.\nInspector of the Traffic Investigation Wing (East), of Coimbatore City Police, R.

The decision has been taken to avoid law and order problem after Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada A.B. Ibrahim issued an order to the NHAI to stop collecting the increased users\u2019 fee till the model code of conduct for Lok Sabha elections ends. The NHAI had hiked the users\u2019 fee from April 1.\nMr. Mishra said that he had also written to the Deputy Commissioner that the NHAI would hold him responsible for the revenue loss during the period as the model code of conduct does not prohibit from increasing the fee.\nGopalakrishna Melanta, the contractor collecting the fee, said that the fee was being collected as per the old rates from Sunday. It would continue till further orders from the NHAI, he said.\nAs per the old rates, cars and jeeps have to pay Rs. 20 while light commercial vehicles have to pay Rs. 30. The NHAI has displayed the old rates at two boards at the booth. Recently, there were protests by the Aam Aadmi Party activists led by Lok Sabha candidate M.R. Vasudeva, opposing the hike.\nAssault\nMeanwhile, residents of Brahmarakutlu on Saturday held a snap protest at the toll booth demanding police action against those who allegedly attacked workers at the toll booth on April 16 morning and on the early hours of April 19. The workers in protest also boycotted work on Saturday. As a result no fee was collected.\nA group led by Hassiner, a person accused in many criminal cases, allegedly assaulted Girish and Samit, two toll gate personnel, in the early hours of April 16. The attackers also damaged barricades placed at the toll booth. The injured toll gate personnel, who are from Brahmarakutlu, filed a complaint with Bantwal Town Police Station. Satyajit, also working at the toll gate, was attacked allegedly by the same group in the early hours of Saturday.\nThe residents on Saturday alleged that police were not taking action against Hassiner as he was being shielded by District in-charge Minister B. Ramanath Rai.\nAllegations denied\nDenying the allegations, Mr. Rai told The Hindu on Sunday that the law will take its own course and the police were free to take action against persons accused of assault. Mr. Rai said the attack followed a verbal duel between toll gate personnel and Hassiner and his group. \u201cThere are complaints against rude behaviour of toll gate personnel with motorists. The Congress will take up this issue,\u201d he said.\nThe Bantwal police said Hassiner was involved in cases involving attempt to murder, robbery, rioting and assault cases. \u201cAction is being taken to arrest Hassiner and his group,\u201d said Additional Superintendent of Police T.P.

The move is aimed at ensuring transparency and smooth conduct of the examinations.\nGerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations, said, \u201cUnder this initiative, answer books will carry photographs of the student as well as their UID number which they tend to fill up wrongly due to exam stress.\u201d\nTill 2015, each examinee had to write her\/his name, unique identification number (UID), and the name of the subject on the answer sheet booklets.\nFrom 2016, the answer sheet will have students\u2019 photograph, name, UID, and name of the subject printed on it. The number of pages of the answer booklets will remain the same \u2013 16 for ICSE and 20 for ISC. The portion of the top-sheet of a booklet that will bear the name and photograph will be torn off and retained by the council before the scripts are distributed for evaluation.\nThis will be done to ensure confidentiality. Once the scripts are marked, the results will be prepared by matching the UIDs with the corresponding names in the council's database. The new system is aimed at preventing mistakes committed by students while writing their names and UIDs.\nThe council will send the answer booklets of the students in separate packets. Each packet will have the photograph and other identity details of the student printed on it. Each sealed packet will contain the answer booklets of all subjects in which the particular student will take the examination. That means if a school has 150 ICSE examinees, it will receive as many packets containing answer booklets.\nTill 2015, the council used to send the answer sheets in bundles of up to 500 booklets each. The booklets were distributed according to their serial numbers.

The three districts are extremely important as they share borders with southern Chhattisgarh, where the revolutionary movement is in a strategic offensive stage.\nFor the Maoist think-tank, the only hope of reviving the extremist movement in Andhra Pradesh was through incursions in Karimnagar, Khammam, and Warangal bordering Chhattisgarh or through the agency areas of East Godavari and Visakhapatnam, which share borders with Orissa, where the Maoist movement is significantly strong. Though Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts too share borders with Orissa, the Maoists not very active in the border areas of these two districts. Adilabad, is another district which shares borders with Gadchiroli side of Maharashtra.\nThe Maoist party pinned its hopes on the KKW division committee for implementing its grand plan to revive the revolutionary movement in Telangana. Strategically, the KKW committee and the squads under its command confined themselves to areas in Chhattisgarh borders because of the relative safety they enjoyed, but were moving into Khammam, Karimnagar and Warangal forest areas.\nThe only other possibility of rebuilding the Naxalite movement in Andhra Pradesh was ordering the underground cadres in Orissa to move into the agency areas in East Godavari and Visakhapatnam.\nBut the series of setbacks the Naxalite movement suffered in Orissa recently, made the Maoist leaders to depend mainly on the KKW committee, which has been eliminated now in Tuesday\u2019s encounter.\n\u201cWith the KKW committee being eliminated now, it will take at least five years for the Maoists to build the cadre again,\u201d a senior police officer analysed.\nSix hail from Warangal\nOf the nine bodies of Maoists recovered in the Sukma encounter, seven were identified.
