new delhi: facing the all indian institute of medical sciences has proved costly for safdarjung hospital. now it is facing the brunt of the aiims strike as well. as resident doctors in aiims struck work for the third day on friday, patients arriving at safdarjung's casualty ward have doubled in the last two days. safdarjung hospital's medical superintendent dr jagdish prasad said: ``we usually receive about 1,300 patients in the casualty ward. the number has touched 2,200 since the aiims doctors went on strike.'' he said the hospital authorities had not posted more doctors in casualty to take care of the extra load. ``our resources are limited and we are trying our best,'' he said. at the casualty, a doctor on duty said all 20 beds in that wing were occupied. ``so far we have been able to provide treatment to all the patients who have come to us. if the aiims strike does not end soon, the situation may turn grave,'' she said. with the aiims out-patients department also shut, safdarjung hospital is receiving more than its share. ``yesterday (thursday) we received about 7,800 patients in the opd, against the usual 6,000 patients,'' dr prasad said. he said he had requested his staff to try and accommodate as many patients as possible. ``unlike other hospitals we cannot turn away a patient even if we do not have a vacant bed. our doctors had to attend to all patients registered with our opd,'' he said. a senior doctor said it was not the first time that safdarjung hospital had been overloaded. ``every time aiims staff goes on strike, we mentally prepare ourselves for more work. even when there is no strike at aiims we are used to receiving patients turned away by them,'' he said.
