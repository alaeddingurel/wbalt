bellary: the cpm on thursday demanded judicial as well as cod inquiries into the vanenur incident in which a dalit woman was stripped and paraded naked for more than two hours on sunday evening. cpm karnataka secretariat member s.y. gurushantha told reporters the cod inquiry should find out the lapse on the part of police and why they failed to frame a strong case against the seven accused. judicial inquiry is necessary to unearth reasons why continuous assaults and humiliation are unleashed on dalit and weaker sections of the society. he demanded that the government hold the deputy commissioner and police superintendent responsible for their "failure to initiate strong action against the culprits". the cpm worker said party's fact-finding team that visited the village found out the following points: political patronage encouraged the nayak community to commit such a barbaric act; most nayak community members own lands; they are hand-in-glove with the police; those who rendered yellamma naked had earlier assaulted members of dhobi community. gurushantha alleged that the culprits have strong support from the congress leaders of the district, particularly the legislator representing the constituency of which vanenur is a part. therefore, he urged both union and karnataka governments to study the vanenur case in detail. gurushantha said the cpm and allied parties will launch agitation in the district and taluk headquarters from monday seeking action against the accused.
