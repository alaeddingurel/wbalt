"barot knows that the days of his government are numbered. he knows that he wouldn't be a minister again and wants to cash in on the opportunity. this is why he has sanctioning a self-financed colleges", said angry student leaders. they argued that education was state's primary responsibility and one can't expect all people to dole out huge sum of money as fees for getting admissions. "everybody is not rich. even today majority of the people in our state are either poor or hail from the middle class", said former msu students union vice president amar dhomse. he suspected that there was a design in minting money in the name of payment seats. "first they deliberately gave a very high hsc result. then they trumpeted 'not having enough seats in colleges'. later, very swiftly, they propagated this theory of solving the admission problem through self-financed colleges", dhomse said. he said student leaders would continue demonstrating their protests against the blatant commercialisation of higher education. student leaders burn effigy of state minister of higher education bharat barot near dn hall cricket ground on ms university campus on monday.
