gulbarga: the karnataka government would consider ordering a judicial inquiry into the communal clashes which claimed three lives in hubli, once a detailed report was received from the district and the police administration in this regard, state home minister mallikarjuna kharge on saturday said.
he told reporters, the violence was triggered during a rally organised by the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) on the occasion of the 75th birthday celebrations of its international president ashok singhal.
he said, additional director general of police (law and order) m.d. singh is camping in the trouble-torn city. kharge claimed the situation was limping back to normalcy and the day curfew would be relaxed accordingly.
refusing to point an accusing finger on any individual or organisation, he said, an official report on the incidents was expected to throw light on the issue. once the report was submitted, the cabinet would discuss the issue and decide the future course of action. kharge clarified that the sudden transfer of the hubli-dharwad city commissioner m.y. patil had nothing to do with the violence. it was a routine administrative transfer, he added.
