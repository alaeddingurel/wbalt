hubli: the residents of mahaveer nagar succeeded in getting the hubli dharwad municipal corporation (hdmc) reverse their earlier decision of handing over the 22 guntas of open space in the locality to kutchi dasha oswal jain mahajan, which wanted to construct a community hall on the land. following a protest demonstration by the residents against the proposed move, hdmc mayor firdous konnur on thursday gave a direction to develop the land into a park `as desired by the residents'. when the protesters led by senior youth congress leader ish kohli, held a demonstration just before the beginning of the council meeting, firdous came down and received a memorandum demanding not to handover the property to the private organisation. the issue came up for discussion in the council meeting, though some of the corporators were against discussing the issue before taking up the subjects in accordance to the agenda. there was a majority opinion to develop the site into a park. it may be recalled here that the times of india had carried a report on the proposed move of the hdmc to lease out the site to build the community hall, much against the wish of the local residents. the first move against the wishes of the residents was made when sarala bhandge was the mayor. it was then that a resolution was hurriedly passed to build the community hall. this came in for sharp criticism by the residents of mahaveer colony and a number of representations were given to the hdmc against the move. infact, the said site was kept as a lung space when the mahaveer colony was formed in 1978. what had come as surprise for the residents was the relevant documents supporting the claims of the residents that the area was allotted as lung space went missing.
