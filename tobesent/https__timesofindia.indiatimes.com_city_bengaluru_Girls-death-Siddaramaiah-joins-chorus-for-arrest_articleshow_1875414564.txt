mysore: the campaign by local organisations demanding the arrest of the accused in the death of 12-year-old domestic aide lakshmi under mysterious circumstances, received support from karnataka janata dal(s) president siddaramaiah here on wednesday.
he demanded an inquiry into the alleged atrocities by the police against protesters on tuesday, and the arrest of the maid's employer.
at a press meet, siddaramaiah condemned the attitude of the police towards the protesters led by writer ramdas and former mayor narayan. he said, the police action was violation of basic rights of an individual in a democracy. he suggested the organisation should approach the national human rights commission (nhrc).
``the police had no business to beat up protesters. the police should have handled the situation in a mature fashion.''
the jd(s) leader said, the demand of the protesters was ``just,'' and added that there was no hitch for the police in booking the case, as the house owner had violated labour laws by employing lakshmi for only rs 2,000 a year.
he also said there was no law which prohibited people from protesting in a peaceful manner.
the members of various organisations led by narayan and ramdas took out a protest march on wednesday and demanded a thorough inquiry into the alleged brutality of the police .
more than 1,000 protesters members who started from town hall raised slogans against the police and the government and later submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner against the city police commissioner. deputy commissioner basawaraj who received the memorandum in turn promised the protesters to inquire into tuesday's incident.
