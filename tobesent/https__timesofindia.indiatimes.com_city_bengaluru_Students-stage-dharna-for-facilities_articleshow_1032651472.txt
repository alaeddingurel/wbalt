hubli: students of government primary school in girinichala, near here, staged a dharna in front of the tahsildar's office demanding better facilities for their school.
the 50-year-old school has 250 students from classes first to fifth. five classes are held in just two rooms having no `proper roofing'. ``rain or shine, we are forced to hold classes in these conditions,'' the school authorities complained. they have been demanding these facilities for the last five years. the other demands include a separate site for the school and funds to constructing a building to house five classrooms.
