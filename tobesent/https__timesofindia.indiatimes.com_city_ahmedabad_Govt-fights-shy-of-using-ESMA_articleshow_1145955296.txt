gandhinagar: even as the teachers' strike entered 14th day on monday the state government restrained itself from putting into effect the provisions of esma. the government announced a contingency plan under which trained teachers will be appointed with a daily wage of rs 200 to resume teaching activities in 5,800 schools from tuesday. speaking to reporters after a high-level meeting convened by chief minister keshubhai patel, minister of state for information and higher education bharat barot claimed that the total number of schools which reopened on monday stood at 2,100. he reiterated that it was not possible to concede to the demand for vehicle allowance at this stage as the state was already burdened by drought and earthquake. "we have decided to give striking teachers more time, and will declare the strike illegal only after some time." however, he did not spell out any deadline for initiating any action against teachers under esma. district education officers have been asked to appoint teachers as per the plan evolved by the government to deal with the situation. referring to the token strike by non-teaching employees of universities, the minister said there was no question of the state government sanctioning vehicle allowance as the non-teaching employees were governed under university grants commission rules. the youth wing of the bjp and other voluntary and educational institutions have started mobilising public opinion against the strike by organising meetings of parents.
