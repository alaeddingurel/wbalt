hyderabad: andhra pradesh congress committee president m satyanarayana rao, clearly upset and angry over the rumblings in the party over a rift in kurnool congress as well as what he called backstabbing by some leaders in the recent panchayat raj elections, said: "wait till the 20th of this month and see what i will do."
responding to a question on some party leaders criticising him for addressing thousands of d vishnuvardhan reddy's supporters who came from kurnool to gandhi bhavan on friday, rao said those who criticise him should know that people, when in an agitated mood, need to be heard and placated.
"anyone in my position would have done the same," he said.
speaking to reporters after receiving a memorandum from kurnool dcc president kotla jaya suryaprakash reddy and others against vishnuvardhan reddy, rao said he was not informed by the dcc about the planned demonstration in hyderabad on friday. "it was the dcc leadership's failure. they should have informed me. they also did not inform me that the dcc had issued a show cause notice to vishnuvardhan reddy," rao said.
the apcc president made it clear that he would present memoranda submitted by vishnuvardhan reddy against kotla vijayabhaskara reddy and others as well as the one received on monday before the aicc observer after august 20. on the demand from party mla shikhamani to suspend clp leader y s rajasekhara reddy from the party, rao dismissed it saying "tomorrow they will ask for my sacking."
