chandigarh: as the inld government in haryana completes two years in office on tuesday, the relationship between chief minister o p chautala and the bjp may come under strain following the induction of jat leader ajit singh into the union cabinet. chautala has been opposing singh's inclusion in the ministry and had organised a number of rallies against him in saharanpur, bulandshahar and muzzafarnagar, considered the strong holds of ajit singh in western up. chautala's immediate reaction was to accept the development as prime minister's prerogative. but he has already made known his intentions clear by attacking the late charan singh's son as an 'unreliable man'. "i am a blind follower of atalji. but when it comes to the interest of farmers, i will not tolerate any injustice," he remarked at a dinner press conference hosted on monday night to mark two years of his government. despite an uneasy relationship with bjp at the state level, chautala has had a smooth sailing in the last two years in office.
