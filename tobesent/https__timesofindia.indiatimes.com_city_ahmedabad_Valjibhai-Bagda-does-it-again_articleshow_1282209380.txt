rajkot : valjibhai bagda, congress party spokesman for saurashtra and kutch, is known for his surprise demonstrations and rallies on national issues. to highlight the 'failure' of the union government in protecting the 'hindus of jammu', he stood in front of the ramakrishna ashrama here on wednesday with a placard that described the "govt of india" as 'goat of india'. in the placard he made minor changes and replaced the letter 'v' with 'a' to symbolise the failure of the union government to protect citizens. he clams the government machinery has become 'goat' in the face of growing terrorism in jammu where innocent people are being killed by extremists. among those killed last fortnight in jammu were balkrishna gidharilal and ramnath. he says when 'ram and krishna' get killed, the union home minister lal krishna advani should own up responsibility and quit. valjibhai bagda's solo demonstration did attract curious passers-by and for a few minutes even the ramakrihna ashrama witnessed traffic jam. group of congressmen were also there to cheer him up and bolster his morale.
