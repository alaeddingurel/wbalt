shimoga: the 50 cobra eggs found near mundigesara in the heggodu forest near sagar in june have perished due to lack of proper care. the incident aroused a lot of interest and subsequent agitation by the people of sagar as dfo shivaraj singh allegedly manhandled manmath kumar -- a herpetologist. it may be recalled that the dfo raided the house of manmath kumar who had collected the eggs from the forest with the help of people to hatch them. the dfo manhandled him and also photographer krishna, who had taken photographs of the cobra laying eggs in the forest. the agitated people staged a dharna in front of the dfo office for two days. but with the intervention of district incharge minister kagodu timmappa, who assured action against the dfo, people withdrew their agitation. later the dfo sent the eggs to bannerghatta national park for hatching. it is now confirmed by the forest department that the eggs have not been hatched due to excess heat and lack of proper humidity. meanwhile, krishna, the photographer, has filed a petition in a sagar court against the dfo for manhandling him. the court has permitted the petition and the sagar rural police have registered a case against the dfo.
