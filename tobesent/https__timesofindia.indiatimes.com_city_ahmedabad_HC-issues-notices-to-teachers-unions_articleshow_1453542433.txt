HC issues notices to teachers' unions
TNN | Sep 10, 2001, 11.11 PM IST
the petitioner has sought steps to end the strike, harsh steps against the striking staff, including appointment of fresh staff in place of the striking teachers.
asserting her rights under article 226, article 21 and 41 of the constitution of india, she contended that no headmaster and member of the teaching and non-teaching staff shall resort to any form of strike in connection with any matter, pertaining to conditions of their service.
she claimed that teachers are well protected and that they are not transferred and they also enjoy approximately 184 holidays in a year. they also engage tuition classes and write guide books to supplement their income.
besides, they are given maximum salary in view of the fifth pay commission recommendations.
looking at all these, and, particularly, in view of the fact that the xth, xith and xiith are a turning point in a student's career, it can be said that continuance of the strike amounts to denial of right to life under article 21 and denial of education under article 41 of the constitution. the petitioner prayed that the state be asked to restore education facilities immediately.
