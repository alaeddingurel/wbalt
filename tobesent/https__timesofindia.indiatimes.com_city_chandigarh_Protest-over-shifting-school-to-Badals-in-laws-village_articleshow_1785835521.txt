bathinda: about a hundred persons from chak ram singh wala village of this district held a demonstration in front of the government school in the village, on monday, protesting the alleged political move to shift the location of the school.
villagers, including women and children, sat on an indefinite dharna in front of the school after locking it, in protest against the move to shift the school to chak fateh singh wala village, the village of punjab chief minister parkash singh badal's in-laws. they said the dharna would not be lifted till the government clarified its stand.
villagers said that on may 5 some of them had met the chief minister when he was at his in-laws' place, and had managed to persuade him to upgrade the village school. they alleged that in the guise of upgrading the school, some officials of the education department conspired to hand over the control of the school to the panchayat of chak fateh singh wala village.
villagers said that a notification of the education department wrongly mentioned that the state government had decided to upgrade chak fateh singh wala high school to senior secondary level. they said there was no high school in chak fateh singh wala village, and the school mentioned was situated in chak ram singh wala village.
though officials of the education department claimed that the change of name from chak ram singh to chak fateh singh was ``inadvertent'' and a ``clerical'' mistake, villagers alleged that it was part of their conspiracy to hand over the control of the school to the panchayat of chak fateh singh wala, thus serving their purpose of pleasing the chief minister's in-laws. villagers said they were agitated when last week the education department transferred a teacher to the upgraded school named as government senior secondary school, chak fateh singh wala, instead of chak ram singh wala.
