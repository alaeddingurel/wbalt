new delhi: the delhi high court on friday proposed to set up a permanent reference tribunal to adjudicate on hospital strikes, under a retired high court chief justice.
a division bench comprising chief justice arijit passayat and justice d k jain said the tribunal would have union health secretary and labour secretary as two other members, with the medical superintendent of all india institute of medical sciences as its convener.
the proposal was mooted by the court in the light of the recent strike by doctors and employees in aiims.
the court, which had initiated suo moto action for ending the strike by aiims' resident doctors and its group c and d employees, directed standing counsel maninder singh to apprise it about the centre's stand on the proposal for setting up the reference tribunal by october 1.
the court said any dispute which could not be resolved, by the departmental committees of any health institution, would be referred to the tribunal for adjudication. the court made it clear that the tribunal would only deal with disputes arising within the institutions and will have nothing to do with the policy decisions of the government or by institutes including aiims.
