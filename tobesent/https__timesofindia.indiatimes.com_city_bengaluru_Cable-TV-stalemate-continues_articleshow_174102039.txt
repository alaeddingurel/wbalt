bangalore: for viewers caught in the on-going war between star and cable tv operators, it seems like a long wait before they can begin viewing their favourite programmes, for neither the cable operators nor star is willing to relent to the pressure by the viewers. at a meeting convened on thursday by the protesting karnataka state cable tv operators' association and the msos (except hathway), it was reiterated that star transmission was indefinitely switched off. ``we have very reasonable demands, and we expect star to concede,'' a spokesperson of the association said. meanwhile some operators linked to hathway led by suresh kumar, dgm of hathway, on wednesday met joint commissioner (traffic) ajai kumar singh to seek protection from the agitators who ``force us to switch off star channels and create a nuisance in front of hathway office.''
